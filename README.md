Pinboard Extension
==================

This is a _really_ simple toolbar extension for your web browser, which allows for quickly adding a bookmark to [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in).

Available for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

Installation
____________

Just drag and drop the `pinboard.xpi` file (Firefox) or the `pinboard.crx` file (Chrome) in your browser.

In Firefox you will have to right click your toolbar and choose "Customize" and then drag the Pinboard icon to the toolbar.

**Planned**
I plan on updating the chrome version very soon to be more like the Firefox version.

I would like to also add auto detection of tags in the meta data of a webpage.
